==== Stardew Valley Save Downgrader ====

What's this?
As the title says, it's a simple save downgrader for Stardew Valley.

Why I made this?

This is made to make your save data be compatible with Console versions of the game (Ex: Switch, Xbox or PS)

(Only tested on Switch)

I just made this to make easier to change the game version of the game instead of exploring and edit the files manually. With this, you can just modify the version without damaging the save data while being automatic.

BUT A REMINDER CAN BE MADE:
Don't donwngrade the BASE VERSION of the game to play in another platform, due to the additional contents newer base versions tend to receive, this CAN CORRUPT your save file.

----ONLY DOWNGRADE BUGFIXES/HOTFIXES PATCHS VERSIONS----

IN CASE someone does this, the program will make a backup of your save data at where the .exe is located for protection, then you can just restore from it replacing the original save files manually by copying and pasting. 

TO UPDATE THE GAME VERSION:

Just play the latest release and save the game, this will update your save files.

OBS: If the day comes where the console versions don't get behind in updates and be equal to the PC version, this program will no longer be useful as it is already a little useless.
